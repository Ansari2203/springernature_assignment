Technical challenge regarding the Springer Nature Digital data science team
Welcome to the challenge! A dataset has been provided for you to work on, it's about identifying some fake news around the recent Covid-19 outbreak. You have one week to deliver it! We don't necessarily expect a high performance of your model - we are more interested in your design, reasoning and tests.
Instructions
The main focus of this challenge is to build a model for binary classification (beware that currently this is a multiclassification problem so you will have to convert it into a binary problem)
Dataset description:
⚫ verifiedby: Company/site that verified the news ⚫ country: country that is verifying it
• class: Either true or fake (Label)
⚫ title: Title of the news (in english)
• published_date: Timestamp of news publishing • country1: Country where news was shared ⚫ country2: Country where news was shared ⚫ country3: Country where news was shared ⚫ country4: Country where news was shared
⚫ article_source: Website link for the article that either classifies the news with truth or false ⚫ ref_source: Reference source
⚫ source_title: Title of the news (original language)
• content_text: New's article content
• category: New's category
⚫lang: New's source language
1. Create a private repository on Github and commit all your code there
2. We advise you to follow Github's best practices in a dev environment
3. Clearly state what are your objectives (comment your code!)
4. Start by visualizing the data, stating your assumptions to solve the problem
5. After having a good idea of what you are solving, start by building a model to classify a piece of news
6. Future work is also recommended if you had any idea that wanted to put into practice but couldn't! 7. When you're done, share your repo with the following user: @jehrodrigues
Good Luck! :)
Notes:
• Please don't share any of your solutions online
• Any questions or doubts don't hesitate to ask! Even sharing what you are doing/stating your challenges is recommended
